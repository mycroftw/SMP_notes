## 4C/4D/4NT: keycard opposite 3-suiters

Only used when shape and strength known, and shape is 1445 minus a card (any shortness, any suit).  This helps with "what suit is trump?" in these three-suited auctions.

- 4C: puppet to 4D, then bid is slam invite in that suit (4NT/4M is RKC)
- 4D: END SIGNAL: puppet to 4H, then 4D bidder places the contract
- 4H: RKC in low suit
- 4S: RKC in middle suit
- 4NT: RKC in high suit

Example:
2D-2NT;
3D- Opener has 4414 or 4405 max.  Now: 
- 4C: bid 4D, I'm going to make a slam try and tell you what trump is
- 4D: bid 4H, I'll tell you where we're playing
- 4H:  KC for clubs (the low suit)
- 4S: KC for hearts (middle suit)
- 4NT: KC for spades (high suit)
