# SMP_notes
Things I need to learn/review to get from Precision Today to SMP.

Current links:
## 1C:
- [1C-1D; 1M](./1C-1D-1M.md): very common sequence, Artificial 2C and 2D responses, a lot of artificial third-round bids for all common responses (1S/1H, 1NT, 2C, 2D)
## 1D:
- [General Responses](./1D-otherodd.md)
- [1D-2C and 2D](1d-2m.md): INV+ (usually GF), one or both minors.  MANY artificial rebids.
## 2C:
- [Responses](./2C_responses.md): Responses to the 2D inquiry are very new, 2NT+ "transfer responses".
## 2D:
- [Responses](2d-followups.md): 2NT "new", but simple.
- [4C/4D/RKC](4c4d4nt.md): how to handle "what's the trump suit".  WARNING: Forgetting is a real problem...
